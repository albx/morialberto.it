# My personal website and blog
This repository contains the source code of my personal website and blog (Italian language).

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or PRs if you have any idea of blog post or content changes.

## Work in progress
I'm still migrating the website from a shared hosting to Azure Static Web App. 

http://www.morialberto.it is currently pointing to the shared hosting instance, but it will be soon mapped to the Azure Static Web App.
